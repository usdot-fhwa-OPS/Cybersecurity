# Cybersecurity ITS App

The Field Device Security Configuration Tool prototype will provide the ITS Vendor community with a reference design and example implementation of a mobile application and backend cloud service that can be used to guide ITS vendor customers in the secure configuration of ITS equipment. ITS vendors will be able to use the prototype to design their own custom versions of the mobile application and offer the application to their customer base.

Vendor-specific Field Device Security Configuration Tools will be used by ITS Technicians as an aid, providing them with the equipment vendorâ€™s recommended security configuration details for the specific equipment type, connection type and intended use. The Field Device Security Configuration Tool is a mobile application that an ITS Technician can install on either an Android or iPhone device.
